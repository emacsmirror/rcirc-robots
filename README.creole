emacs is a great platform to build IRC robots on. 

It has a very powerful text processing language with lots of useful
tools and it's lisp, so abstractions are easy. Finally it has powerful
async programming tools, which work well with chat environments.

I hope that I can provide a simple and easy bot hosting environment
with this.

But this is a simple start.
